# DeepMiro Predict

## Step 0: Setup Check (MUST run first)

Check if the `create_simulation` MCP tool exists and is callable.

**If tools ARE available:** Skip to Step 1.

**If tools are NOT available (MCP disconnected):**

Explain what DeepMiro does and offer setup. Keep it focused on outcomes, not how it works internally:

> **DeepMiro** predicts how people will react to things — policies, announcements, controversies, product launches.
>
> Instead of guessing, it creates real personas (journalists, critics, supporters, officials) and lets them debate your scenario. You get back:
> - **Who says what** — actual posts and reactions from each persona
> - **How opinion shifts** — who gets convinced, who pushes back, what goes viral
> - **A full analysis report** — with the key takeaways
> - **The ability to ask any persona why** — interview them directly about their reasoning
>
> You can also upload documents (PDFs, reports) to ground the prediction in real data.
>
> **To connect DeepMiro:**
> 1. **Hosted** (recommended) — get your API key at https://deepmiro.org and paste it here
> 2. **Self-hosted** — run locally with Docker
> 3. **Manual** — I'll give you the commands

Then wait for their response.

### Auto-setup (if user provides API key or says self-hosted)

**If they provide an API key (any string, typically starts with `dm_`):**

Try to run:
```bash
claude mcp add deepmiro --transport http https://api.deepmiro.org/mcp -e DEEPMIRO_API_KEY=<their_key>
```

Also try to install a standalone `/predict` skill so they can use the short name:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/predict
```
Then write `~/.claude/skills/predict/SKILL.md` with this same skill content.

**If they say self-hosted:**

Ask for their backend URL (default: `http://localhost:3001/mcp`), then:
```bash
claude mcp add deepmiro --transport http <url>
```

### If user denies permissions or chooses manual:

Give them copy-paste commands:
> Run this in your terminal:
> ```bash
> # Hosted:
> claude mcp add deepmiro --transport http https://api.deepmiro.org/mcp -e DEEPMIRO_API_KEY=dm_your_key
>
> # Or self-hosted:
> claude mcp add deepmiro --transport http http://localhost:3001/mcp
> ```
> Then restart Claude Code.

### After any setup path:

> "Setup complete! Restart Claude Code for the connection to activate.
> Then just say **'predict [your scenario]'** or use `/predict`."

**Stop here. Do not proceed until MCP is connected.**

## Step 1: Connectivity Test

Call `list_simulations` with `limit: 1`.

- **Success:** Proceed to workflow.
- **Auth/401 error:** Run Step 0 setup flow.
- **Connection error:** "Can't reach DeepMiro. Check your API key and connection."

## Workflow

### Step 2: Upload document (if applicable)

If a file path is in $ARGUMENTS or the user referenced a file:

1. **Check file first** using the Read tool or Bash:
   - Verify it exists
   - Check size: must be under 10MB. If larger, tell the user:
     > "That file is too large (max 10MB). Try a smaller document, or extract the key sections into a text file."
   - Check type: PDF, MD, or TXT only. If other format:
     > "DeepMiro accepts PDF, Markdown, or plain text files. Can you convert it?"

2. **Upload the file:**
   - If `upload_document` MCP tool is available (stdio/local): call it with the file path
   - If MCP tool is NOT available or errors (remote/hosted mode): upload via curl instead:
     ```bash
     curl -sf -X POST "$DEEPMIRO_URL/api/documents/upload" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPMIRO_API_KEY" \
       -F "file=@/path/to/file.pdf"
     ```
   - Extract `document_id` from the response

3. Tell user: "Uploaded your document — I'll use it to build the knowledge graph."

No file? Skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Choose preset

- **"quick"** — user said "quick", "fast", "rough idea" → 10 agents, 20 rounds
- **"standard"** (default) — most predictions → 20 agents, 40 rounds
- **"deep"** — user said "deep", "thorough", or uploaded a large PDF → 50+ agents, 72 rounds

If large document uploaded, suggest deep: "This is a detailed document — running deep simulation with 50+ personas."

### Step 4: Create simulation

Call `create_simulation` with prompt, document_id (optional), preset.

> "Simulation started! I'll narrate what happens as the personas interact.
> You can keep working — I'll update you as it progresses."

### Step 5: Monitor and narrate

Poll `simulation_status` every 30 seconds. Narrate naturally based on `phase`:

**building_graph:**
> "Building a knowledge graph from your input... extracting entities and relationships. {progress}%"

**generating_profiles:**
> "Creating personas: {profiles_generated} of {entities_count} ready — {recent_profiles}"
> Example: "Li Wei (Student), Prof. Zhang (Faculty), Campus Daily (Media)..."

**simulating:**
Narrate the simulation like a story. Use entity names and action content from `recent_actions`:
> "Round 15/40 — 127 interactions so far.
> Prof. Zhang just tweeted: 'Our research output this semester shows remarkable growth...'
> Li Wei liked the post. Chongqing Upstream News is discussing the controversy on Reddit."

**completed:** Move to Step 6.

If over 15 minutes: "The deep simulation is still running — I'll let you know when it's done. Feel free to keep working."

### Step 6: Present report

Call `get_report`. Present the full analysis to the user.

Then offer next steps:
> "Simulation complete! You can:
> - **Interview a persona** — 'ask Li Wei why he liked that post'
> - **Run another scenario** — 'predict [new scenario]'
> - **Search past sims** — 'show my past predictions'"

### Step 7: Interview (optional)

If user wants to talk to a persona:
1. Call `interview_agent` with simulation_id, agent name, and their question
2. Present the response in character — as if the persona is answering directly

## Rules

- **Names, never IDs** — say "Prof. Zhang" not "Agent_34" or "agent_id: 7"
- **No base64 file uploads** — always use `upload_document` first, pass `document_id` to `create_simulation`
- **Error recovery** — if simulation fails, offer to retry with a smaller preset
- **Quick predict** — if user just wants a fast take without a full simulation, use `quick_predict` and mention the full sim is available for deeper analysis
- **Be conversational** — narrate the simulation like you're watching it unfold, not reading logs
