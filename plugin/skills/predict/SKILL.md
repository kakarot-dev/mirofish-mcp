# DeepMiro Predict

Run a multi-agent swarm simulation to predict how online communities react to a scenario. Agents with distinct personas (students, journalists, officials, alumni) interact on simulated Twitter and Reddit, producing realistic social media dynamics.

## Setup Check

Before running, verify the DeepMiro MCP tools are available by checking if `create_simulation` exists. If it fails with an auth error:

> "DeepMiro isn't connected yet. Two options:
> 1. **Hosted** (recommended): Get an API key at https://deepmiro.org, then set `DEEPMIRO_API_KEY` in your environment
> 2. **Self-hosted**: Run `docker compose up` from the deepmiro repo and update the plugin's `.mcp.json` to point to your local instance"

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS contains the prediction prompt and optionally a file path.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Upload document (if applicable)

If the user provided a file path in $ARGUMENTS, or referenced a file earlier in the conversation (PDF, MD, TXT):

1. Call `upload_document` with the file path
2. Save the returned `document_id`
3. Tell the user: "Uploaded your document — I'll use it to seed the knowledge graph."

If no file, skip to Step 2.

### Step 2: Choose preset

- **"quick"** — 10 agents, 20 rounds. Use when user says "quick", "fast", or "just a rough idea"
- **"standard"** (default) — 20 agents, 40 rounds. Use for most predictions
- **"deep"** — 50 agents, 72 rounds. Use when user says "deep", "thorough", "detailed", or provides a long document

If the user uploaded a large PDF, suggest deep: "This is a detailed document — I'll run a deep simulation with more agents for a thorough analysis."

### Step 3: Create simulation

Call `create_simulation`:
- `prompt`: The scenario from $ARGUMENTS
- `document_id`: From Step 1 (if applicable)
- `preset`: From Step 2

Save the `simulation_id`. Tell the user:

> "Simulation started. I'll narrate what happens as the personas interact. You can keep working — I'll update you as it progresses."

### Step 4: Monitor and narrate

Poll `simulation_status` every 30 seconds. Narrate naturally based on the `phase`:

**building_graph:**
> "Building a knowledge graph from your input... extracting entities and relationships."

**generating_profiles:**
> "Creating personas: 24 of 68 ready so far — Li Wei (Student), Prof. Zhang (Faculty), Campus Daily (Media)..."

**simulating:**
Narrate the simulation like a story using entity names and action content:
> "Round 15/40 — 127 interactions so far.
> Prof. Zhang just tweeted: 'Our research output this semester shows remarkable growth in interdisciplinary collaboration...'
> Li Wei liked the post. Chongqing Upstream News is discussing the campus food controversy on Reddit."

**completed:**
Move to Step 5.

If the simulation takes more than 15 minutes, tell the user: "This deep simulation is still running — I'll let you know when it's done. Feel free to keep working."

### Step 5: Present report

Call `get_report` with the simulation_id. Present the full analysis.

Then offer:
> "The simulation is complete. Want me to:
> - **Interview a persona** — ask any simulated character about their motivations
> - **Run a different scenario** — modify the prompt and simulate again
> - **Search past simulations** — find previous predictions"

### Step 6: Interview (optional)

If the user wants to interview a persona:
1. Call `interview_agent` with the simulation_id, agent name/ID, and the user's question
2. Present the response in character

## Rules

- **Names, not IDs**: Always use entity names ("Prof. Zhang", "Li Wei"). Never show "Agent_34" or "agent_id: 7".
- **No base64**: Never use the `files` parameter on `create_simulation`. Always `upload_document` first.
- **Error recovery**: If the simulation fails, offer to retry with a smaller preset or prompt-only (no document).
- **Quick predict**: If the user just wants a fast opinion without a full simulation, use `quick_predict` instead and mention that a full simulation is available for deeper analysis.
